<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> Is the command `ftxvalidator` (Apple Font Tool Suite) available?</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/ftxvalidator_is_available](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/universal.html#com.google.fonts/check/ftxvalidator_is_available)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
There&#x27;s no reasonable (and legal) way to run the command `ftxvalidator` of the
Apple Font Tool Suite on a non-macOS machine. I.e. on GNU+Linux or Windows etc.
If Font Bakery is not running on an OSX machine, the machine running Font Bakery
could access `ftxvalidator` on OSX, e.g. via ssh or a remote procedure call
(rpc).
There&#x27;s an ssh example implementation at:
https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery/blob/main/prebuilt/workarounds
/ftxvalidator/ssh-implementation/ftxvalidator</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** Could not find ftxvalidator. [code: ftxvalidator-available]

<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> Checking OS/2 achVendID.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/vendor_id](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/vendor_id)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
Microsoft keeps a list of font vendors and their respective contact info. This
list is updated regularly and is indexed by a 4-char &quot;Vendor ID&quot; which is stored
in the achVendID field of the OS/2 table.
Registering your ID is not mandatory, but it is a good practice since some
applications may display the type designer / type foundry contact info on some
dialog and also because that info will be visible on Microsoft&#x27;s website:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/vendors/
This check verifies whether or not a given font&#x27;s vendor ID is registered in
that list or if it has some of the default values used by the most common font
editors.
Each new FontBakery release includes a cached copy of that list of vendor IDs.
If you registered recently, you&#x27;re safe to ignore warnings emitted by this
check, since your ID will soon be included in one of our upcoming releases.</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** OS/2 VendorID value 'NONE' is not yet recognized. If you registered it recently, then it's safe to ignore this warning message. Otherwise, you should set it to your own unique 4 character code, and register it with Microsoft at https://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/vendorlist.aspx

* [com.google.fonts/check/name/license](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/name/license)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
A known licensing description must be provided in the NameID 14 (LICENSE
DESCRIPTION) entries of the name table.
The source of truth for this check (to determine which license is in use) is a
file placed side-by-side to your font project including the licensing terms.
Depending on the chosen license, one of the following string snippets is
expected to be found on the NameID 13 (LICENSE DESCRIPTION) entries of the name
table:
- &quot;This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.
This license is available with a FAQ at: https://scripts.sil.org/OFL&quot;
- &quot;Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0&quot;
- &quot;Licensed under the Ubuntu Font Licence 1.0.&quot;
Currently accepted licenses are Apache or Open Font License.
For a small set of legacy families the Ubuntu Font License may be acceptable as
well.
When in doubt, please choose OFL for new font projects.</pre>

<pre>--- Rationale ---
A known license URL must be provided in the NameID 14 (LICENSE INFO URL) entry
of the name table.
The source of truth for this check is the licensing text found on the NameID 13
entry (LICENSE DESCRIPTION).
The string snippets used for detecting licensing terms are:

<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> Are there caret positions declared for every ligature?</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/ligature_carets](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/ligature_carets)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
All ligatures in a font must have corresponding caret (text cursor) positions
defined in the GDEF table, otherwhise, users may experience issues with caret
rendering.
If using GlyphsApp or UFOs, ligature carets can be defined as anchors with names
starting with &#x27;caret_&#x27;. These can be compiled with fontmake as of version
v2.4.0.</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** This font lacks caret position values for ligature glyphs on its GDEF table. [code: lacks-caret-pos]

<pre>--- Rationale ---
Fonts with ligatures should have kerning on the corresponding non-ligated
sequences for text where ligatures aren&#x27;t used (eg
https://github.com/impallari/Raleway/issues/14).</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** GPOS table lacks kerning info for the following non-ligated sequences:

* [com.google.fonts/check/gdef_spacing_marks](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/gdef.html#com.google.fonts/check/gdef_spacing_marks)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
Glyphs in the GDEF mark glyph class should be non-spacing.
Spacing glyphs in the GDEF mark glyph class may have incorrect anchor
positioning that was only intended for building composite glyphs during design.</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** The following spacing glyphs may be in the GDEF mark glyph class by mistake:

* [com.google.fonts/check/gdef_non_mark_chars](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/gdef.html#com.google.fonts/check/gdef_non_mark_chars)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
Glyphs in the GDEF mark glyph class become non-spacing and may be repositioned
if they have mark anchors.
Only combining mark glyphs should be in that class. Any non-mark glyph must not
be in that class, in particular spacing glyphs.</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** The following non-mark characters should not be in the GDEF mark glyph class:
